              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7
              body: >
                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Update the resin-ntp-config script to work with dynamic chrony

                source configuration. Any NTP sources configured by config.json

                are added to a chrony sources file. Changes to the sources file

                are picked up by chrony either when it starts up or at runtime

                using the chrony-helper script.


                A systemd service has been added to run the resin-ntp-config
                script

                once at boot. Previously the script was being run up to 8 times
                at

                boot via a NetworkManager dispatcher script.

                Update the existing DHCP dispatcher script for adding NTP
                sources to

                make use of dynamic chrony source configuration. Any DHCP
                configured

                NTP sources for a particular interface are added to a sources
                file on

                network 'up' or DHCP lease renewal events. Any DHCP configured
                NTP

                sources for a particular interface are deleted on network 'down'

                events. Changes to the sources file are picked up by chrony
                either

                when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.


                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network
                interface

                comes back up.

                Add the 'sourcedir' parameter to the chrony configuration to

                dynamic source configuration files. Any NTP source files that
                are

                chrony

                source configuration at runtime.


                Add a helper script to support the dynamic re-loading of chrony

                sources. This script uses the chrony 'reload sources' feature.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of
                this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary
                into

                a separate procps package:

                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into
                compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than
                gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Upstream changes to the kernel have switched to a shared x86

                insn decoder required by tools/objtool so we must add those

                include and lib components to our target dir.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.
