                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is fixed
                upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression ratio.

              body: >
                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

              hash: 795e2427821d28fcf894da1cba9afc245efc38b3
              body: >
                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA" UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="resin-rootA" PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as a fallback

                method to identify devices.

                Not all the boards we support have the redsocks uid as 995 in their rootfs
                so let's

                fetch the actual redsocks uid from the DUT before running the proxy tests and

                update that in the docker-compose.yml. We do so because the REDSOCKS_UID value

                isn't substituted in the compose if the variable, even if it is passed trough

                the cli.

              body: >
                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                Generate a bmap file from the sparse image to allow for punching holes

                in the disk image ranges that were unmapped after building. This data is

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                writing, and verifying the sparse image.

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds
                        interval,

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for local

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

                The task that applies the aufs patches is still required to support

                hostOS updates between aufs and overlay2 balenaOS versions.


                This commit adds support for 5.15 kernels and improves the branch

                selection logic to cover some corner cases.


                It also adds a test task so that we can test regressions.

                The move to include the ABI in the target definition was done in Poky:

                d6b563710e6cc0857843433d85023d47f9f2037d


                Without much explanation in the commit, the ABI was removed in Poky:

                e4c16d11128f0e9cc2567fc9e3579e9a94988b2e


                Only to be re-introduced, also without much explanation in Poky:

                0bf2fd16273436f1cd9ea2ab99ad882e879f965d


                Then, there was a partial revert to remove the ABI again in Poky:

                66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48


                This last 66ff1fb3a164fa794ee186960809e3fa9e938b48 commit is reverted here as

                it fails to build for ARM targets. All our boards that cover all the

                possible ABIs build with this change.

                        The 243390 device specific tests assess that the hotspot
                        connection is created on the intended interface. We thus
                        need to ensure that the connection to the testbot is
                        established using the embedded wifi chip.

                        Unfortunately the standalone balena-cli package is linked to glibc

                        and does not work with musl (alpine) so we need to switch to debian.


                        The trade-off seems worth it for build times though.

                Instead of querying devices w/ `fdisk -l`, glob match patterns specified

                in resin-init-flasher.conf with devices present in `/dev`. This allows us to

                specify devices like `hd? sd? mmcblk?` instead of individual device

                numbers, which don't consistently map to any particular disk.


                This also allows RAID arrays to be matched with the array name and a

                pattern that glob matches even arrays assembled automatically on a

                non-matching host, such as `md/balena?(_?)` matching an array named

                `balena` and assembled on-device at `/dev/md/balena_0`.

                These packages also install kernel images into the boot directory in the

                root partition, overwriting the initramfs kernel installed by

                kernel-image-initramfs.


                Before kirkstone, the way to not include the kernel image was to

                override the `RDEPENDS:${KERNEL_PACKAGE_NAME}-base` not to include

                `kernel-image`, as was done in the `kernel-resin-noimage` class.


                Kirkstone changes the dependency from RDEPENDS to RRECOMMENDS in

                Poky's commit f6d963fa6d0e64d53f7ef56fd2c12d67f5811829


                Now excluding the kernel image needs to `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "kernel-image-*"`

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for ppc64le

                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible to find

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

                The arch_to_rust_arch() function was introduced to cater for ppc64le

                systems and is not present in older Yocto releases.


                This commit reverts to the previous way of setting the rust architecture.

                It will not work for ppc64le and if we would need to support such an

                architecture the arch_to_rust_arch() function will still be called if it

                exists in Kirkstone or newer Yocto versions.

                With Kirkstone and the support of openSSL 3.0 it's not possible to find

                a set of dependencies that work for all of our rust applications across

                the 1.32 to 1.62 toolchain versions that are supported across all the

                Yocto versions we keep compatibility with.


                This layer allows to set a preferred version as a distro setting that can

                be used across all Yocto versions.


                These rust recipes come from Poky Kirkstone

              body: >
                Previously, our healthcheck verified if we were able to start a new

                container. This had two downsides:


                1. It was relatively heavyweight. In devices under heavy load, it would
                   sometimes take so long to run that the Engine was killed by the
                   watchdog.
                2. It wrote to the storage media. Creating a container involves writing
                   some data to persistent storage, therefore the healthcheck was
                   wearing the storage media.

                This new healthcheck simply pings both `balenad` and `containerd`, which

                is much faster than starting a new container and doesn't write to disk.

                The step of pinging `containerd` is important because we have seen at

                least one case in the past in which `balenad` was working but

                `containerd` wasn't.

                With `WatchdogSignal=SIGTERM` systemd will send a SIGTERM and give the

                Engine 90 seconds to gracefully shutdown before sending a SIGKILL. We

                had cases of Engine metadata on disk getting corrupted after the

                watchdog sent it a SIGKILL directly. This change shall minimize this

                issue.

                Recent versions of meta-balena include a balena-rust layer used to

                specify a distro-set Rust version across all supported Yocto versions


                As such, the syntax of this layer also needs to be converted.

                This is a temporary way that will allow to update the bblayers.conf of

                device type repositories to include meta-balena/meta-balena-rust while

                still building.


                This change will be reverted with the meta-balena-rust layer.

      hash: 4f025d12c10d5917451a18429f5dcafa36fddd0d
      body: |
        Maintaining compatibility with the existing legacy BIOS boot method
        while switching to GPT is technically infeasible. Switch back to
        generic-amd64 slug to offer generic x86_64 UEFI/GPT as a separate device
        type.

        This reverts commit 63557bef9a828c0aef7d4196875bb2f77aed2bdc.

                Our tests perform two HUPs (into and out of the release under test), and

                the code for both of these HUPs were duplicated. This commit factors

                this code out to a common function.

                This is a small improvement over our previous test: in addition to

                checking that the volumes themselves are preserved over HUPs, we now

                check if the contents of these volumes is preserved.


                Resolves #2428

                The boot partition is currently a FAT filesystem that does not support

                atomic writes. To prevent corruption, this commit introduces a fatrw

                application that needs to be used both when reading and writing files

                to the boot partition to provide safe accesses.

                        The executeCommand family of methods default to retrying on failure. In

                        some cases, such as in the ssh-auth test in the cloud test suite, we

                        expect failures to happen, and want them to be raised immediately. Other

                        situations might demand adjusting the number of retries and interval to

                        fit specific tests. Add a retryOptions object to these methods to allow

                        for this behavior to be configured.

                By creating empty configuration units when no configuratin is applied to

                a service instead we avoid regenerating them at boot if stored in

                This allows for specific devices to override the defaults, which is to

                store configuration units on volatile memory re-generating them every

                boot and avoiding storage media writes.


                Changing this to permanent storage trades boot times with media life

                expectancy.

                Currently `os-config-json` is also parsing `units-conf.json` at runtime.

                This is expensive to do for smaller devices, so this commit performs the

                processing at build time.


                For this, it also splits the configuration units processing in

                balena-config-vars into its own recipe to allow for task ordering.

                environment that is recreated when `config.json` changes and will be

                used if present.

                spurious error messages.


                With mDNS resolution memoization, this optimization no longer saves us

                time, so remove it.

                When accessing a test device as part of a fleet, a cloud API key is

                required in order to generate an SSH key and access the device through

                the VPN. However, when accessing a device locally, such as a QEMU

                instance running on the workstation itself, we have a direct path, and

                no VPN is necessary.


                Make the apiKey optional, and don't login when it's not specified. This

                allows direct connections to work without it.

                        redundant and adds latency.

                We may have cases when for some boards we do not want

                to have all these files blacklisted. See for example

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-rockpi/commit/b5eadcfb3a296eea2554dc0cbdd16002d51c5169


                In conclusion, we rework how the blacklist is constructed

                so that users of meta-balena can alter this list as they see fit.

                This changes the condition in the unit file from checking whether

                /dev/disk/by-state/balena-efi exists to checking whether /mnt/boot/EFI

                is a symlink. The original approach has a race condition populating

                the by-state symlink - it is depending on udev and if the link is

                not present when the service is started (after the boot partition is mounted),

                the service fails and the EFI partition is never mounted.


                The new approach does the trick pretty well - /mnt/boot/EFI is a symlink

                if the EFI partition is split and a regular directory in case there is a single

                boot partition. That said the service is only started when necessary

                and the waiting for udev is implemented as a part of the mount script.

                Recent versions of GRUB default to use shim_lock when in secure boot mode.

                We do not use shim and do not build the shim_lock module into GRUB EFI binary

                therefore this needs to be disabled.

                Add a healthcheck that will check that the NTP sources are reachable

                and the system time does not skew.


                The healthcheck will command a burst sync if there is no selected

                reachable source, and will restart chronyd if the system clock skews.


                Fixes #2314

                        Device addresses likely won't change during a single test run, and mDNS

                        queries can be time consuming. Memoize the result of the query to save

                        some time.

                        Splash image backend would throw if the image is not a valid png during

                        the write step. This could prevent the device from provisioning if some

                        corruption happens at some point.

                        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot to do it

                        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +

                        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.


                        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`

                        endpoint.


                        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

                        The status field does not indicate the current state of the Engine on the
                        device.

                        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


                        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

                        use the `appState` field in the response.

                        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning up locks it creates
                        due

                        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

                        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

                        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


                        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

                        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

                        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

                        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

                        Migration `M00008` had a bug with the check for legacy apps, which

                        resulted in devices that had at some point been updated from a single

                        container supervisor to get the error


                        ```

                        Undefined binding(s) detected when compiling UPDATE. Undefined column(s): [appUuid] query

                        ```


                        This adds a new migration with the fix to ensure broken fix the

                        inconsistent database state.

                        This change updates types and database format in order to allow

                        receiving the new format of the target state from the cloud and allow

                        applications to keep working.


                        This change also updates metadata in the containers, meaning services

                        will need to be restarted on supervisor update

                        It seems that in some cases the supervisor can report

                        an image without a `status` field leading to a cloud side 401 response.

                        See #1905 for more details.

                This reverts 5047757 where we set the global DHCP timeout for ipv4 to

                infinity to mitigate problems with routers that do not respond to DHCP

                requests in time.


                This however causes issues on some routers, which after power cycle fail to

                renew leases after they are expired.


                The same ipv4.dhcp-timeout can be specified on per connection basis. Since

                the case with lease renewal due to router power cycle is a more common case,

                it is better to keep the global dhcp-timeout default unmodified. If the

                setting needs adjustment then it can be overwritten in the particular

                connection profile.

              hash: c4ce541526455c8cb891e7c76889e0d4cb2735b1
              body: >
                There are known situations in which balenaEngine times out during

                initialization (for example, during aufs to overlayfs migrations, or

                when restarting a device that was running a large number of containers).

                When these time outs occur, Systemd kills the Engine, causing further

                problems.


                To avoid these cases, this commit disables timeouts during the Engine

                initialization.


                This is also aligned with the default Systemd settings distributed with

                the Moby project.

                        This adds two new integration tests:


                        * TestDeltaSize: this is meant to catch regressions on delta sizes. It
                          generates deltas and compare their sizes with the delta sizes we get
                          as of now. If the size increases, the test fails.
                        * TestDeltaCorrectness: checks if applying a delta indeed results in the
                          same image as we had originally.

                        A number of different test cases (different images with distinct

                        features) are tested for each of these integration tests.

                Starting with v2.91.6 device provisioning will not start if the device

                was unable to register in the cloud due to lack of internet connectivity.

                To avoid this, we switch to retrying 3 times with the usual 2 second delay

                between attempts, after which the flashing process will start.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

                  scripts/basic/fixdep: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34'

              hash: fb171dc507348e11ab2c6ed894289f51689fc874
              body: >
                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel patch
                backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                from the main one.

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                As per https://jel.ly.fish/a533a6bd-1c98-412c-ae60-8427e3f7b005,
                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                Retrieves the last meta-balena version, which may not be the same as the

                last meta-balena tag.


                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

                tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last meta-balena version

                will be a proper semver.

                For the time being we are still using a version label in the hostapp.

                At runtime we can now enable development features that were previously

                configured using the development-image feature. That feature also

                configured U-Boot for OS development.


                Now we have two distinct functionalities:


                * A runtime development configuration variable that configures the

                device to facilitate application development

                * A build time osdev-image feature that configures the OS for BSP and OS

                development


                This allows us to merge the current production/development images into

                a single image.

                The images now can be configured for application development mode at
                runtime.

                This commit introduces a built time option to configure them for BSP or

                other OS development like board bringup.

                        and fixes the cleanup logic bug, where the old aufs root would never be

                        cleaned up.

                        In these cases we want to avoid restarting the same services

                        manually from the supervisor.

                        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to

                        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

                        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

                        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

                        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

                        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


                        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

                        journal logs as


                        ```

                        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
                            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
                        ```


                        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

                        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

                        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

                        database should be side effect free.

                        environment

                        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

                        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

                        comparisons for v2 target state.


                        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

                        - serviceId to be replace by serviceName

                        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


                        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

                        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

                        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

                      body: >
                        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

                        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

                        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

                        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

                        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

                        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


                        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

                        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


                        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

                        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

                        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

                        releases or between services in the same release.

                        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance from the

                        db module but that was leading to issues when running tests using `test:fast`.

                        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

                        call entirely (it turns out it is not necessary).

                This is not a problem when using kernel-source as a modules_prepare is

                always required.

        The linux-yocto package includes no defconfig, and specifying
        KCONFIG_MODE="--alldefconfig" results in a config containing only
        architecture defaults, with meta-balena overrides and machine specific
        overrides. This results in a lack of hardware support unless it's
        explicitly enabled.

        Copy the full defconfig from balena-intel, used for the
        genericx86-64-ext device type, itself based on an Ubuntu config.

                on/offline status of the NTP sources on 'connectivity-change' events

                instead of 'up/down' events.


                Currently 'chronyc onoffline' is run for 'up/down' events on any

                network interface. It makes more sense to run it for

                'connectivity-change' events as we are really interested in whether

                the internet is there or not rather than whether an interface is

                up or down.

              hash: 31c3ae8ad5c7ad45e450349b6972524da120e96c
              body: >
                Most major distributions now ship kernels with user namespacing enabled

                in the kernel config. Some distributions, such as Arch and Ubuntu,

                default to the upstream behavior of allowing unprivileged user

                namespacing, regardless of potential attack surfaces exposed in the

                kernel.


                Other distributions, such as Debian, are slightly more conservative,

                disabling the feature at runtime behind a sysctl tunable. Debian

                maintains its own patch to add the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone

                tunable.


                The Debian patch was rejected by upstream over fears of application

                developers not using this feature due to it being generally unavailable

                in systems, as well as fears of bugs going undiscovered.


                RHEL uses a newer tunable introduced upstream to set the max number of

                user namespaces to zero, which accomplishes the same thing, but without

                an out of tree patch.


                Disable user namespacing at runtime using the same method as RHEL, in

                the same manner as the hardened kernels and distributions have chosen.

                There is at least a case in a board where the puts function in u-boot's

                such cases by correctly looping through more than one function

                In recent kernels (i.e. 5.10.31 for Raspberry Pi) the

                arch/arm/kernel/module.lds file got moved. See

                https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/

                596b0474d3d9b1242eab713f84d8873f9887d980 for details.


                Hence we use in meta-balena-dunfell the upstream kernel-devsrc from the

                hardknott-3.3.1 Poky release which handles this module.lds move.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                This avoids a compile error on kernel 5.10.31 on arm64

                raspberrypicm4-ioboard for example where it would complain _mcount is

                undefined because the older gcc in the intel-nuc-debian:stretch-20190717

                base image would not create the _mcount symbol when compiling against

                the newer 5.10.31 kernel.

                Resolve `latest` to dev variant


                If we want the serial logs of the DUT the image that is flashed needs to

                be the development variant. The `latest` shortcut however always

                resolves to the production image. We manually resolve the version to fix

                this.

                Currently it is possible to build a docker image that will then fail to

                hup due to a lack of space on the inactive partition.


                Add a task to check the docker image space against the available space on

                the root filesystem partition and fail the build if it's too big.

                Replace the IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE magic number with a calculation based on

                the partition sizes on the balena image classes.


                The rootfs size is calculated with the assumption of a total BalenaOS

                size of 700M. This includes boot, state, rootA and rootB partitions. The

                data partition will then grow to occupy the rest of the storage media.


                Device integration layers can override this value if needed.

                Instead of hardcoding the requested root filesystem value, let's explain

                how the calculation is made with a python function that will adjust based

                on the sizes of other partitions.

                Add a new systemd service to check for full network connectivity.

                This service is required because the default NetworkManager (NM)

                connectivity checker doesn't differentiate between the

                CONNECTED_LOCAL, CONNECTED_SITE and CONNECTED_GLOBAL states. This

                service checks for the CONNECTED_GLOBAL state only and can be used

                to delay the start of other services which require full network

                access to be available. This can help to avoid startup problems on

                networks with slow DNS access or that utilise a captive portal.


                The script does an initial oneshot check of the NM state to make sure

                that we don't wait for an event that doesn't come. This check is

                redundant at boot time due to the fact that the service is started

                before NM to ensure that no NM DBus events are missed. The initial

                check is useful in circumstances where you want to run the script

                standalone or post-boot.


                Other services that wish to make use of this service and wait for

                full network connectivity should add the following entries to their

                systemd unit definition:


                Requires=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                After=balena-net-connectivity-wait.target

                This makes it easier to overwrite the arguments passed in the engine

                unit from drop-in overwrites. See the development image drop-in unit for

                reference.


                Using `systemctl edit --runtime balena.service`, which puts those

                overwrites into `/run/systemd/system/balena.service.d/`, it would be

                possible to modify the runtime behavior of the engine without remounting

                the rootfs to be writeable.

              hash: d965d23fe60db6254eaabd81a0d48b5718e01a3a
              body: >
                The hostapp-update hooks would run before the supervisor update step

                when using balenahup via the dashboard. This resulted in the balena

                supervisor state conf file being out-of-date.


                This commit removes the hostapp-update hook and instead uses a

                oneshot service to ensure the conf is migrated if it does not exist

                in the new path before starting the supervisor.

                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet, and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
                      body: >
                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

                        can be used.

                        config vars based on the os/supervisor version so that they are

                        available on the first target state fetch rather than having a delay

                        whilst waiting for the supervisor to report them as part of a state

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version no longer uses the

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                        the need

                        for custom composer types for network.


                        This commit also modifies network tests to use the new types

                In order to verify GPG signature of grub.cfg it must be immutable.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

              hash: 7d6ec3d411af78b9b1f979b90461e9efb059e4e7

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface

                We need to make sure the firmware cleanup function runs before

                do_populate_sysroot otherwise do_populate_sysroot will race with it and

                will fail complaining about the missing firmware that

                iwlwifi_firmware_clean had just deleted at the same time.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile properly:


                Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6
              body: >
                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

                a separate procps package:


                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.
