Subject: [PATCH] HACK: Use the UNAME26 personality to return armv6l instead of
 v2.6.32+

We'd like to make our arm builders return two different machine strings
at runtime for different processes. armv7l and armv6l. This is so that
a docker daemon for armv6l/armv8l device builds thinks the docker build
is unning under the correct machine arch. Various package managers such
as pip rely on the output of uname -m to be correct.

The UNAME26 personality is used by old userspace programs to make the
kernel version string appear as 2.6+.

Add a hack in the kernel to modify the machine string for the uname26
personality and make it show armv6l. And don't change the kernel
version string to 2.6.+

The benefit of this hack instead of adding a new personality is
- we won't have to carry a custom version of the setarch userspace utility
- simpler to implement and keep lying around

Trade-off. I'm hoping no customer is pushing applications that depend
on the kernel version string being 2.6+ and the actual uname26
personality usage.

With this patch and compat_uts_machine=armv7l in the kernel cmdline
on our arm builder

root@arm02:~# linux32 --uname-2.6 uname -m
armv6l
root@arm02:~# linux32 uname -m
armv7l
root@arm02:~# uname -m
aarch64
root@arm02:~#
